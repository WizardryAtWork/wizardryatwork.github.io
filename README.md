# README

Welcome to my portfolio website, designed to showcase my projects and experience. This site is hosted on GitHub Pages and built using Jekyll with the Chirpy theme for an organized, modern, and highly customizable design.

Technology Stack
1. Jekyll
Purpose: Jekyll is a static site generator, converting Markdown files into a complete website with minimal setup and maintenance. Ideal for blogs, portfolios, and personal websites.
Customization: Enables easy customization, allowing me to add my own styling, scripts, and adjust layouts directly within the codebase.

2. Chirpy Theme
Theme Choice: Chirpy was selected for its simplicity, readability, and effective organization suited for showcasing content.
Features: Includes built-in support for tags, categories, a blog index, and social media integration.
Adaptability: Offers flexibility to tailor the website's look and feel, such as customizing color schemes, layout structure, and widgets.

3. GitHub Pages
Hosting: The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, which serves the site directly from the GitHub repository without needing an external server.
Version Control: Using Git allows me to track changes over time, manage content updates, and collaborate if needed.
Domain: The site is accessible through my custom domain, adding a professional look and enhancing my personal brand.

This site is meant for personal use - but feedback is welcome :)
