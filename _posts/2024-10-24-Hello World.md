title: "Hello World!" 
---

Welcome to my newly minted website! Built using **Jekyll & Chirpy.**

I plan to dive deep into the various technical and creative projects that occupy my time. 
	This post can be seen as a "Hello World" or Test Post :) 

- The site is hosted on GitHub Pages, utilising my domain with HTTPS enabled. 
-  I've set up a custom email through ProtonMail - clay@clayatownsend.com

These were a great help for understanding the setup process using Jekyll, Chirpy, and GitHub Pages.

( special thanks to those who made these guides, sending love their way <3 )

Most of this journey involved an avoidance of documentation. - Obviously leading to a lot of unnecessary work and troubleshooting... ðŸ˜…

My next post will most likely be a detailed exploration into my home lab. I'll break down what I've set up, how, and why - it will be complete with diagrams and documentation that I used along the way to wrap my head around it all. ( will need to "prettified" first.... )

I'm planning to use this platform to discuss my developments, from its humble beginnings as a gaming PC to its current role as a robust self-host workstation. You'll hear about the setups, the breakdowns, and the inevitable upgrades (my ISP supplied NBN Telstra router from 8 years ago) as I aim for something more robustâ€”likely from Ubiquiti.

Cheers,
